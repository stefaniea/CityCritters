CityCritters
============


###About###
Website was made for AT&T/AppNexus/GirlsWhoCode hackathon in NYC August 2014
The theme for the hackathon was to create a website from a list of 5 or so non-profit organizations.  We love cats and animals so, of course, we chose City Critters!  Also, we won first place for best overall design! (yay)

####Why we chose City Critters####
Our team decided to redesign the City Critters website for several reasons -- the site looks outdated, it's hard to read and most of all you can't even see the animals up for adoption on the actual website -- it links to an external page that you have to wade through yourself. So we really wanted to give the whole site an overhaul, but we ultimately chose to focus on enhancing the user's site experience by adding features like a home video gallery powered by Ziggeo as well as a realtime mobile subscription service powered by AT&T and Clickside.

####Technologies Used####
**Front-End**:

- Bootstrap, Jquery, Jquery UI
- Because we used Bootstrap, the website is responseive.  Try it on your phone!

**APIs**:

*Petfinder API*: on the adoption page - pulls cats from petfinder to directly show a particular shelter's animals

*AT&T SMS API*: on the adoption process page, sign up for SMS messages (though I believe our APIKey has now expired)

*Firebase*: after signing up for SMS texts, name and number get stored in Firebase 

*Ziggeo*: record videos of the adoptable cats with webcam/smartphone camera to be put on the website
